# Events

When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.

Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive. In this chapter, you will learn how:
