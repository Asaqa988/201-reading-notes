White Space

In order to make code easier to 
read, web page authors often 
add extra spaces or start some 
elements on new lines.
When the browser comes across 
two or more spaces next to each 
other, it only displays one space. 
Similarly if it comes across a line 
break, it treats that as a single 
space too. <b> This is known as 
white space collapsing </b>

- <p>The moon is drifting away from Earth.</p>
- <p>The moon is drifting away from Earth.</p>
- <p>The moon is drifting away from 
 Earth.</p> 

##  break tag 
As you have already seen, the 
browser will automatically show 
each new paragraph or heading 
on a new line. But if you wanted 
to add a line break inside the 
middle of a paragraph you can 
use the line break tag <br /> 

<b>
 The Earth<br />gets one hundred tons heavier 
 every day<br />due to falling space dust.</p> </b>
