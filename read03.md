# USING QUOTES INSIDE A STRING
## reading lab 03 

##### Sometimes you will want to use a double or single quote mark within a string. Because strings can live in single or double quotes, if you just want to use double quotes in the string, you could surround the entire string in single quotes. If you just want to use single quotes in the string, you could surround the string in double quotes (as shown in the third line of this code example).

##### You can also use a technique called escaping the quotation characters. This is done by using a backwards slash (or "backslash") before any type of  quote mark that appears within a string (as shown on the fourth line of this code sample).

##### The backwards slash tells the interpreter that the following character is part of the string, rather than the end of it.

## USING A VARIABLE TO STORE A BOOLEAN


##### A Boolean variable can only have a va lue of true or fa 1 se, but this data type is very helpful.



 ## SHORTHAND FOR CREATING VARIABLES
 
 ##### Programmers sometimes use shorthand to create variables. Here are three variations of how to declare variables and assign them values:
 
 1. Variables are declared and values assigned in the same statement.
2. Three variables are declared on the same line, then values assigned to each.
3. Two variables are declared and assigned values on the same line. Then one is declared and assigned a value on the next line. (The third example shows two numbers, but you can declare variables that hold different types of data on the same line, e.g., a string and a number.) 
4.  Here, a variable is used to hold a reference to an element in the HTML page. This allows you to work directly with the element stored in that variable.  more about this on p190.)
