# Basic usage of canvas
The canvas element
At first sight a  canvas  looks like the  img  element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the  canvas  element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted
The id attribute isn't specific to the  canvas  element but is one of the global HTML attributes which can be applied to any HTML element (like class for instance). It is always a good idea to supply an id because this makes it much easier to identify it in a script.
  The  canvas  element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦). These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas. We'll see how this is done in a dedicated chapter of this tutorial. When no styling rules are applied to the canvas it will initially be fully transparent.
  
  ## Fallback content
The  canvas  element differs from an  img  tag in that, like for  video ,  audio , or  picture  elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers
  Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the  canvas  element. Browsers that don't support  canvas  will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support  canvas  will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.
  
  ## The rendering context
The  canvas  element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering; for example, WebGL uses a 3D context based on OpenGL ES.

The canvas is initially blank. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. The  canvas  element has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions. getContext() takes one parameter, the type of context. For 2D graphics, such as those covered by this tutorial, you specify "2d" to get a CanvasRenderingContext2D.

# Drawing shapes with canvas
Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that can be done.

### The grid
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.
 

Drawing rectangles
Unlike SVG, <canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.

First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:
  
  First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a filled rectangle.
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectangular outline.
clearRect(x, y, width, height)
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
  
  ### Drawing paths
  Now let's look at paths. A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:

First, you create the path.
Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.
Here are the functions used to perform these steps:

beginPath()
Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.
Path methods
Methods to set different paths for objects.
closePath()
Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.
stroke()
Draws the shape by stroking its outline.
fill()
Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.

# Drawing text
After having seen how to apply styles and colors in the previous chapter, we will now have a look at how to draw text onto the canvas.
  The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
A fillText example
The text is filled using the current fillStyle
  
  A strokeText example
The text is filled using the current strokeStyle.

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.strokeText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}
