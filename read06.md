# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming
## What is the hardest thing about writing code?

- There are many common answers to this question:

* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable

## A familiar problem
- In a good portion of my Pluralsight courses I show the viewer how to build the “Protein Tracker” application.
- I am often asked why I keep demonstrating how to build the same simple application over and over again in each of my courses.

## The answer is “familiarity.”

- "When I first started using the Protein Tracker example in my Android course, I was just looking for a simple example of an application that could be easily understood and implemented."
- The idea behind the Protein Tracker application is that it allows a user to set a goal for the amount of protein to consume in a day.  The user can add protein amounts which are added to a total protein count that is tracked for that user.

- Very simple functionality, easily explainable, but most importantly, easily understood.

### What I found with this simple application was that because it was so easy to understand, the focus was taken off of the problem domain and put instead on the technology.

### Not only this, but as I reused this same exact application for teaching a variety of different technologies, it served as a reference problem domain that didn’t have to be re-learned, and provided a way to compare and contrast different technologies—I was getting this teaching mechanism for free if a viewer had already watched one of my other Pluralsight courses.

- By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.

###### So what am I trying to say here?

Simply that by taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, I am able to make both teaching and learning easier.

Why problem domains are hard
Have you ever tried to put together a jigsaw puzzle that didn’t have any picture on it?  How about one like this one, that has a very similar pattern repeated on it and is double-sided?
